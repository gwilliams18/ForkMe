1. A branch creates a copy of an existing file, while forking attaches a copy of another file.


2. Timestamps are important for collaborative projects so that the collaborators know when the file was edited. Depending on the
project there could be multiple reasons to know what has been edited in a file.


3. README.md text edit, 28 min ago.

4. To keep the other students from copying my work and to allow the teacher to see my files.

5. Because they explain the constituents of the rest of the file.
